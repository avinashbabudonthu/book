-- multiple table columns that are not included in the GROUP BY clause will be listed in the SELECT statement. some versions of MySQL may not allow such queries, or at least not by default
-- To adjust the relevant default settings, there is a system variable, called ‘sql_mode’, which needs to be reconfigured
-- to view the current value of this variable in your case, you have to execute the following command
select @@global.sql_mode;
-- An expression containing a few values, separated by commas, will appear in the result grid. They correspond to various MySQL settings that influence the way in which MySQL will behave in different situations
-- One of these values, ‘only_full_group_by’, blocks certain type of group statements and that can potentially lead to Error Code 1055. The latter signifies the problem of listing fields in the SELECT statement that are not included in the GROUP BY clause
-- to prevent it from happening, we must execute the following statement
set @@global.sql_mode := replace(@@global.sql_mode, 'ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY', '');
set @@global.sql_mode := concat('ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY,', @@global.sql_mode);
