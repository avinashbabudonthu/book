**Stage of AI**

Artificial General Intelligence

Artificial Narrow Intelligence / Weak AI

Artificial Super Intelligence



**Artificial Narrow Intelligence**

* Performs certain tasks. Examples like Alexa, Siri, Self driving cars etc



**Artificial General Intelligence**

* Strong AI. Machines posses the ability to think and take decisions just like human beings



**Artificial Super Intelligence**

* when capability of computers surpass human beings

**Types of AI**

* Reactive Machines AI - Operates solely based on present data. Take into consideration only current situation. Cannot form inferences from data to evaluate any future actions. Perform narrowed range of predefined tasks. Ex: IBM chess program that beat the world champion Garry Kasparov(1997). One of the impressive machine build so far



* Limited Memory AI - Can make informed and improved decision by studying past data from its memory. Has short-lived or temporary memory that can be used store past experiences and evaluate future actions. Ex: Self driving cars. Has limited memory that use data collected in the recent pasts to make immediate decisions. 



* Theory of Mind AI - more advanced type of AI. This category play important role in psychology. Mainly focus on emotional intelligence so that humans beliefs and thoughts can be better comprehended. Not fully developed yet but rigorous research is happening in this area



* Self Aware AI - Machines has own consciousness and self-aware. 

---

**Machine Learning**

* Making machines to interpret, process and analyze data to solve real world problems.
* Sub types - Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement

---

**Deep learning / Neural networks**

* Process of implementing neural networks on high dimensional data to gain insights and form solutions
* Logic behind **-** face recognition algorithms (in facebook), Self driving cars, Virtual assistance like Alexa, Siri etc

---

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

* Drawing insights from natural human language in order to communicate with machines and grow businesses
* Ex: Twitter - Uses NLP to filter terroristic language in tweets
* Ex: Amazon - Uses NLP to understand customer reviews and improve user experience

---

**Robotics**

* Focus on different branches and applications of robots
* AI robots are artificial agents which act in real world environment to produce results and taking some accountable actions.
* Ex: Sophia the Humanoid is very good example AI in robotics

---

**Fuzzy Logic**

* Computing approach that is based on principle of degree of truth instead of usual modern logic that we use which is basically the Boolean logic. Used in medical fields to solve complex problems which involve decision making. Also used in automating gear systems in cars

---

**Expert System**

* AI based computer system that learns and reciprocates decision making ability of human expert
* Uses if then logic notions to solve any complex problems
* Do not rely conventional procedural programming
* Used in information management, fraud detection, virus detection, managing medical and hospital records
