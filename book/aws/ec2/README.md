# Instance metadata
* Data about instances
* Public IP of instance
* Can be used to configure or manage running instance
* Getting instance metadata
	* Window instance - open url - http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
	* Linux instance - curl url from instance
		* $ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
		* $ GET http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
* all meta data is returned as text (content type text/plain)
------
# Instance user data
* You can specify user data when launching the instance
* user data can be
	* linux script - executed by cloud-init
	* windows batch or powershell scripts - executed by EC2Config service
* user data scripts run once per instance-id by default
* user data is limited to 16KB
* user data should be Base64 encoded before submitted to API. Amazon EC2 command line tools can perform Base64 encoding
* Getting user data - http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data
* Sample user data script to start web server
```
#!/bin/bash
# Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)
# install httpd (Linux 2 version)
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
```
* User data script with Availability zone informaion
```
#!/bin/bash
# Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)
# install httpd (Linux 2 version)
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
EC2_AVAIL_ZONE=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone)
echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f) in AZ $EC2_AVAIL_ZONE</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html

# Getting inside virtual machine with EC2 and VPC
* AWS Console
* click EC2
* open EC2 dashboard
* click 1 Running Instances under Resources
* navigates to instance dashboard
* at the bottom
* under Description we can see there is no  Public IP for this instance
* We can see Private IP
* we can see Availability Zone where this instance has been created
* we can see Key Pair, this is important because we will use same key-pair to connect via SSH
------
# Create and Assign Public IP address to VPC
* To assign this instance an IP address first we need to create an Elastic IP
* AWS Console
	* EC2
	* click Elastic IPs in the left menu
	* click Allocate New Address button
	* click Yes, Allocate button in the popup
	* click Close button
	* Now we have public IP address

	* click Associate button
	* Elastic IP address will be updated with EC2 instance that this IP address is associated with
	* click on instance link
	* navigates to instance details
	* here we can see Public IP address assigned to this instance
	* Copy this IP address so that we can use it in next configurations
------
# Elastic IP
* Public IP addresses that are created, destroyed and assigned independently to EC2 instances
* If underlying instance is terminated then associated IP address can still exist and can be assigned to different instance
------
# Convert pem file to ppk file

* After connecting to EC2 instance using Putty -> run this command
	* sudo yum update
------
# Connect using SSH from Linux or Mac
* Update pem file permissions if you get error like `Permissions 0644 for my-file.pem are too open` 
```
chmod 0400 my-file.pem
```
* connect to ec2 instance
```
ssh -i my-file.pem ec2-user@public-ip
```
------
# Connecting from Windows 10 or later
* Open cmd or powershell
* Navigate to path where `pem` file is present
* Run below command
```
ssh -i my-file.pem ec2-user@ip-address
```
------
# Connect using EC2 Instance connect
* Login to aws console
* Go to EC2 dashboard
* Select EC2 instance which we want to connect
* Click on `Connect` button
* Opens new tab in browser and connects to EC2 instance
------
# AMI
* AMI means `Amazon Machine Image`
* Operating System + preinstalled softwares like Java, perl, python etc used on an EC2 instance
* AMIs are customization of EC2 instance
	* Add your own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring
	* Faster boot/configuration time because all softwares are pre-packaged
* AMIs are built for specific region (Can be copied across region)
------
# Storage termed as
* EBS (Elastic Block Storage) in EC2. EBS is specific to storage used by EC2. EBS is not same as S3
* Independent storage volumes used with EC2 instances
------
# Security Groups
* Little firewals installed per instance basis

# EC2 dashboard 
* Resources: Details of instances/resources we have created
* Running Instances: EC2 instances we have
* Volumes: Elastic Block Storage volumes
* Launch Instance button: To launch new EC2 instance
------
# Scaling EC2 instances
* Expand or Shrink pool of instances
------
# Auto Scaling Group
* Expand or Shrink pool of instances based on pre-defined rules
* Auto configuration has launch configuration which has an image in it, and scaling rules to expand or shrink a pool of instances automatically
* In real life, load on your application can change time to time (sometimes high and sometimes low)
* In the cloud, you can create and get rid of servers very quickly
* Goal of Auto scaling groups (ASG)
	* Scale out (add EC2 instances) to match increased load
	* Scale in (remove EC2 instances) to match decreased load
	* Enusure we have minimum and maximum number of EC2 instances Running
	* Automatically register new instances to load balancer
	* Recreate EC2 instance in case previous one is terminated
* ASG is free (you pay only for underlying EC2 instances)\
![picture](imgs/001-asg-high-level-flow.jpg)
* Auto scaling group with load balancer
![picture](imgs/001-asg-with-load-balancer.jpg)

## Auto scaling group attributes
* A launch template (older launch configurations are deprecated)
	* AMI + Instance type
	* EC2 user Data
	* EBS volumes
	* Security Group
	* SSH
	* IAM roles for EC2 instances
	* Network + Subnet informaion
	* Load balancer information\
![picture](imgs/asg-attributes.jpg)
* ASG has min size, max size, initial capacity
* Scaling Policies

## Scaling Policies
* Auto scaling - CloudWatch alarms & scaling
* It is possible to scale ASG based on CloudWatch alarms
* An alarm monitors metric (such as average CPU, custom metric)
* Metrics such as average CPU are computed for the overall ASG Instances
* Based on the alarm
	* We can create scale-out policies (increase number of instances)
	* We can create scale-in policies (decrease number of instances)\
![picture](imgs/002-asg-cloud-watch-alarm.jpg)
* Dynamic scaling
	* Target tracking scaling
		* simple to setup
		* I want the average ASG CPU to stay at around 40%
	* Simple / Step Scaling
		* When cloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU > 70%) then add 2 units
		* When CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU < 30%) then remove 1 unit
* Scheduled Scaling
	* Anticipate scaling based on known usage patterns
	* Example: Increate the minimum capacity to 10 at 5 PM on Friday
* Predictive Scaling
![picture](imgs/asg-predictive-scaling.jpg)

## Good metric to scale on
* CPU Utilization: Average CPU utilization across your Instances
* Request Count per target: To make sure the number of requests per EC2 instance is stable
* Average Network In / Out (if your application is network bounded like lot of uploads and downloads)
* Any custom metrics (that you push using CloudWatch)

# EC2 Instance Store
* EBS volumes are network drives with good but `limited` performance
* if we need high performance hardware disk then use EC2 Instance store
* Better IO performance because no network latency
* EC2 Instance store lost thier storage if they are stopped
* Good for buffer/cache/scratch data/temporary content
* Risk of data loss if hardware fails
* Backup and replication are your responsibility
------
# Stress test on EC2 instance
* install stress in amazon linux 2 ami instance
```
sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
```
```
sudo yum install stress -y
```
* Use --timeout to stop it automatically e.g. stress --cpu 4 --timeout 60s
* reference:
