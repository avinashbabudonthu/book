# EBS Elastic Block store
* Persistent block level storage volumes offering consistent and low-latency performance
* Automatically replicated within its availability zone
* Snapshots stored durably in Amazon S3
* Suited for applications that require database file system or raw block level storage
* Provides block level storage volumes used with EC2 instances
* EBS attached to EC2, persist independent of life of EC2 instance
* Lifecycle\

* It's a network drive. Means it uses network to communicate the instances, which means there might be bit of latency
* It can be detached from EC2 instance and attach to another one quickly
* It is `locked to one availability zone (AZ)`. An EBS volume in `us-east-1a cannot be attached to EC2 instance in us-east-1b`. To move volume across, we need to snapshot it
* It is a volume so we need to provide capacity (size in GBs and IOPS - IO operations per second)
* Get billed to provisioned capacity
* Increase capacity of drive over time

# EBS Snapshot Features
* EBS Snapshot Archive
	* Move snapshot to `archive tier` that is `75%` cheaper
	* Takes within 24 to 72 hours to restore the archive
* Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots
	* Setup rules to retain the deleted snapshots so you can recover them after accidental deletion
	* Specify retention period from 1 day to 1 year
* Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)
	* Force full initialization of Snapshot to have no latency on first use
	* Careful on using this. This option is `costly`
