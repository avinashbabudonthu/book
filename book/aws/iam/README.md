# IAM Identity and Access Management

# Creating IAM user for aws account
* ![picture](imgs/high-level-view-1.jpg)
* when we first create AWS account, the email and password we used is called `root user`
* `root user` can be used for
	* console access
	* programmatic access
* root user have access to everything in aws account. Like root user can close the account
* so for day to day activities, better to create different set of users calls `IAM` users
